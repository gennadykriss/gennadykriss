# 👋 Hi, I'm Gennady

I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in **backend development, data analysis, and cybersecurity**. I enjoy building practical systems, digging into how things work under the hood, and turning data into real-world insights.

## 💻 What I’m working with
- Backend development (Java, Spring Boot)
- Data analysis & machine learning (Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- Web technologies (React, REST APIs)
- Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
- DevOps basics (Git, CI/CD)

## 🔍 Current interests
- Botnet detection  
- Network security and anomaly detection  
- Scalable backend systems  
- Data-driven decision making

## Fun Facts 😄
- Backend > frontend
- I love rock climbing but I can only climb V3s
- You will not beat me in a game of billiards
- I'm always caffeinated

⭐ Always curious. Always building.
